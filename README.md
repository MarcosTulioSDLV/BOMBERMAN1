Super Bomberman is an action-maze video game developed by Hudson Soft and released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) in 1993, currently owned by Konami. The main goal of the game is placing down bombs, which explode in multiple directions, in order to destroy obstacles and kill enemies until you find the exit door.
